High-frequency measurements of light absorbance were collected at multiple depths in Falling Creek Reservoir (FCR; Vinton, VA, USA) using a s::can Spectrolyser UV-Visible spectrophotometer coupled with a multiplexor pumping system. The system pumps water samples from individual depths into a flow-through cuvette where the UV-vis absorbance spectra of the sample are measured by the spectrophotometer. The system used in our study collected measurements of light absorbance every 2.5 nm wavelengths from 200 nm to 732.5 nm (optical path length of 10 mm) approximately at an hourly time step for seven monitoring depths in the reservoir. Data was collected during two periods; the first deployment (16 October to 9 November 2020) was to observe changes in Fe and Mn concentrations before, during, and after reservoir fall turnover and the second deployment (26 May to 21 June 2021) was to observe the effects of engineered hypolimnetic oxygenation on Fe and Mn concentrations. Partial least squares regression models were developed to generate predictions of total and soluble Fe and Mn concentrations based on the correlation between absorbance spectra and sampling data.
